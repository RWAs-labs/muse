# CCTX status message 

The cctx object contains a field  `cctx_status` , which has the following structure 
```go
type Status struct {
	Status CctxStatus `protobuf:"varint,1,opt,name=status,proto3,enum=musechain.musecore.crosschain.CctxStatus" json:"status,omitempty"`
	StatusMessage string `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=status_message,json=statusMessage,proto3" json:"status_message,omitempty"`
	ErrorMessage        string `protobuf:"bytes,6,opt,name=error_message,json=errorMessage,proto3" json:"error_message,omitempty"`
	LastUpdateTimestamp int64  `protobuf:"varint,3,opt,name=lastUpdate_timestamp,json=lastUpdateTimestamp,proto3" json:"lastUpdate_timestamp,omitempty"`
	IsAbortRefunded     bool   `protobuf:"varint,4,opt,name=isAbortRefunded,proto3" json:"isAbortRefunded,omitempty"`
	CreatedTimestamp int64 `protobuf:"varint,5,opt,name=created_timestamp,json=createdTimestamp,proto3" json:"created_timestamp,omitempty"`
	ErrorMessageRevert string `protobuf:"bytes,7,opt,name=error_message_revert,json=errorMessageRevert,proto3" json:"error_message_revert,omitempty"`
}
```

## Status 
This is the most updated status for the cctx. This can be one of the following values
- `PendingInbound` : The cctx is pending for the inbound to be finalized, this is an intermediate status used by the protocol only
- `PendingOutbound` : This means that the inbound has been finalized, and the outbound is pending
- `OutboundMined` : The outbound has been successfully mined. This is a terminal status
- `Aborted` : The cctx has been aborted. This is a terminal status
- `PendingRevert` : The the cctx failed at some step and is pending for the revert to be finalized
- `Reverted` : The cctx has been successfully reverted. This is a terminal status

### StatusMessage
The status message provides a some details about the current status.This is primarily meant for the user to quickly understand the status of the cctx.
### LastUpdateTimestamp
The last time the status was updated
### IsAbortRefunded
This is a boolean value which is true if the cctx has been refunded after being aborted or not .
### CreatedTimestamp
The time when the cctx was created
### ErrorMessage and ErrorMessageRevert
A cctx can have a maximum of two outbound params. We can refer to the first outbound as `outbound` and the second as `revert`.
- A normal flow for a cctx is to go from `PendingOutbound` -> `OutboundMined` , which creates a single outbound
- A cctx where the outbound fails has the transition `PendingOutbound` -> `PendingRevert` -> `Reverted` , which creates two outbounds
- Any of the above two flows can abort the cctx at some point that can create either one or two outbounds

  - The `ErrorMessage` field only contains a value if the original outbound failed. It contains details about the error that caused the outbound to fail
  - The `ErrorMessageRevert` field only contains a value if the revert outbound failed. It contains details about the error that caused the revert outbound to fail.

### StatusMessage fieldsand how to interpret it
- `initiating outbound` : The inbound votes have been successfully finalized, and the protocol is starting the outbound process
- `revert failed to be processed` : The revert failed. This message also means that the initial outbound has failed.
- `outbound failed` : The outbound failed, The protocol would try to create a revert either in the same block or schedule one to be picked up by museclient
- `outbound failed for admin tx` : The outbound failed for an admin transaction, in this case we do not revert the cctx
- `outbound failed unable to process` : The outbound processing failed at the protocol level. When this happens, the protocol sets the cctx to aborted.
- `outbound failed but the universal contract did not revert` :  The outbound/deposit failed, but the contract did not revert,
   this is most likely caused by an internal error in the protocol. The CCTX is this case is aborted. Users can try connecting with the musechain team to get a refund
- `cctx aborted through MsgAbortStuckCCTX` : The cctx was aborted manually by an admin command


### ErrorMessage and ErrorMessageRevert fields and how to interpret them
- The ErrorMessage and ErrorMessageRevert would contain the following fields. The protocol generates the fields tagged as internal.
```
  - type : Type of error ,Supported types are internal_error(error from the protocol), contract_call_error (error from MEVM call)
  - message [Internal]: A message from the protocol to explain the error
  - error : Error message related to the call
  - method: The method that was called by the protocol
  - contract: The contract that his method was called on
  - args:The arguments that were used for this call
  - revert_reason: Revert reason from the smart contract call, if any
```
Sample error message for a failed deposit (Note empty fields are discarded by default)

```json
{
  "type": "contract_call_error",
  "message": "contract call failed when calling EVM with data",
  "method": "depositAndCall0",
  "contract": "0x733aB8b06DDDEf27Eaa72294B0d7c9cEF7f12db9",
  "args": "[{[]0xdFb74337c53141bf912101b0Ee770FA8e2DCB921 1337} 0x13A0c5930C028511Dc02665E7285134B6d11A5f410000000000000000 0xD28D6A0b8189305551a0A8bd247a6ECa9CE781Ca [114 101 118 101114 116]]",
  "error": "execution reverted: ret 0x: evm transaction execution failed",
}
```

- `outbound tx failed to be executed on connected chain` : `revert tx failed to be executed on connected chain` : The outbound/revert transaction failed to be executed on the connected chain.
- `coin type [CoinType] not supported for revert when source chain is Musechain` : The coin type is not supported for revert when the source chain is Musechain.

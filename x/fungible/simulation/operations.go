// Operation weights are used by the simulation program to simulate the weight of different operations.
// This decides what percentage of a certain type of operation is part of a block.
// Based on the weights assigned in the cosmos sdk modules , 100 seems to the max weight used , and therefore guarantees that at least one operation of that type is present in a block.
// Operation weights are used by the `SimulateFromSeed`
// function to pick a random operation based on the weights.The functions with higher weights are more likely to be picked.

// Therefore, this decides the percentage of a certain operation that is part of a block.

// Based on the weights assigned in the cosmos sdk modules,
// 100 seems to the max weight used,and we should use relative weights
// to signify the number of each operation in a block.
